kindly download and run it on localhost:3000

main.js and chart.js files are for log-in page and dashboars respectively, but the same content is added using script tag on end of the body tag.

Login page notes:
username validation (validating email as username) is done using html tag.
password : "SmartServTest@123" takes to the dashboard page, any other password will redirect to login page.


dashboard page notes :
since,data set is not given I took a dataset of "Price of Netflix in Different countries"(data is also added in the repository).

width of the dashboard is always 100% of the screen, though added css with highest specificity(Select by id), width is not changing.
